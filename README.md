# mpf-python
Multi-process fusion python port

Original repo (matlab implementation): https://github.com/StephenHausler/Multi-Process-Fusion

# What Do I Need To Run This Code?
You will need the similarity matrices of the VPR techniques you want to fuse

# Running The Demo


# How Do I Set It Up?
Algorithm hyperparameters can be set in the file **settings.py**

The file **mpf.py** should be changed according to your matrices and file paths

# How Do I Run It?
Run the file  **mpf.py**

# Extra Features
The orignal matlab implementation was hardcoded to work with exactly 4 techniques; this port
allows for any number of techniques to be fused.
